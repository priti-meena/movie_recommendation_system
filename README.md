### Movie-Search ‚ñ∂
Along With This, There Is The Movie-Search Model, Which Generates Information About The Movie Name Entered By The User, Such As Movie Rating, Actors, Plot, And So On. It Also Has A Feature That Allows You To Watch The Movie's Trailer. A User Can Also Add A Movie To His Or Her Wish List.

## Learning From The Project

From how to sort information stored in a DataFrame according to different conditions to how to get useful information, the project taught me a lot about data management and handling. I looked at a lot of different recommendation models before coming up with this one that gives the user reliable recommendations.

This project made use of content-based filtering, cosine similarity, and the KNN Algorithm, among other things. Making the application more user friendly in general took up a significant portion of the development period. Web scraping was also important since acquiring reliable data was a lot more important and time-consuming operation than constructing ML models based on that data. With other features such as movie posters, IMDb links, movie information, and watching trailers, I've tried¬†my best to provide as accurate suggestions as possible.
